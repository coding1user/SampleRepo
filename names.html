<!--	This is an application which helps a user retrieve their login username.
		The user enters in their name and email address, and their login name is returned.
		1. Look for syntax errors or missing tags in the following HTML code and correct them.
		Suggestions include:
			A. Opening tags with missing closing tags
			B. Closing tags missing the "/" character
			C. Other tags that are completely missing from the HTML document
		2. Set the First Name, Last Name, and Email text boxes so that the user must populate them
		3. Set the form's method attribute to "post"

		NOTE: You may compare this to code we've worked on over the past couple of days for help
